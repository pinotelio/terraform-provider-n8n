# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an n8n credential. Credentials store authentication information for external services and APIs used by workflow nodes.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/n8n_credential/resource.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Credentials can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import n8n_credential.example 1
```

## Notes

- The `data` field is marked as sensitive and will not be displayed in logs
- Credential types must match the types supported by your n8n instance
- When a credential is deleted, it is permanently removed from n8n
- Ensure no workflows are using a credential before deleting it
