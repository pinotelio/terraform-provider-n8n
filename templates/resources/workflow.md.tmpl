# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an n8n workflow. Workflows are the core automation building blocks in n8n, consisting of nodes and connections that define the automation logic.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/n8n_workflow/resource.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Workflows can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import n8n_workflow.example 1
```

## Notes

- The `nodes` and `connections` fields must be valid JSON strings
- Workflow IDs are assigned by n8n and cannot be changed
- When a workflow is deleted, it is permanently removed from n8n
- The `active` field controls whether the workflow is running
