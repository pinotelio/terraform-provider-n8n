# n8n_user (Resource)

Manages an n8n user. Users can have different roles and permissions within the n8n instance.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a basic user
resource "n8n_user" "member" {
  email = "user@example.com"
  role  = "global:member"
}

# Create an admin user
resource "n8n_user" "admin" {
  email = "admin@example.com"
  role  = "global:admin"
}

# Create a user with minimal information (email only, defaults to global:member role)
resource "n8n_user" "minimal" {
  email = "minimal@example.com"
}

# Create multiple users using for_each
variable "team_members" {
  type = map(object({
    email = string
    role  = string
  }))
  default = {
    "dev1" = {
      email = "dev1@example.com"
      role  = "global:member"
    }
    "dev2" = {
      email = "dev2@example.com"
      role  = "global:member"
    }
  }
}

resource "n8n_user" "team" {
  for_each = var.team_members

  email = each.value.email
  role  = each.value.role
}
```

### Optional

- `role` (String) Role of the user (e.g., 'global:owner', 'global:admin', 'global:member')

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the user was created
- `id` (String) User identifier
- `is_owner` (Boolean) Whether the user is an owner
- `is_pending` (Boolean) Whether the user account is pending activation
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the user was last updated

## Import

Users can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import n8n_user.example 8efb6ce5-3e21-4835-9d32-4135e870e912
```

## Notes

- Valid roles are: `global:owner`, `global:admin`, `global:member`
- User IDs are UUIDs assigned by n8n
- When a user is deleted, they are permanently removed from n8n
- Email cannot be changed after user creation (requires replacement)
