# n8n_workflow (Resource)

Manages an n8n workflow. Workflows are the core automation building blocks in n8n, consisting of nodes and connections that define the automation logic.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1: Using individual attributes with proper trigger node
resource "n8n_workflow" "example" {
  name = "My Example Workflow"

  nodes = jsonencode([
    {
      id          = "1"
      name        = "Schedule Trigger"
      type        = "n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger"
      typeVersion = 1.2
      position    = [250, 300]
      parameters = {
        rule = {
          interval = [
            {
              field         = "hours"
              hoursInterval = 1
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      id          = "2"
      name        = "HTTP Request"
      type        = "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest"
      typeVersion = 4.2
      position    = [450, 300]
      parameters = {
        url    = "https://api.example.com/data"
        method = "GET"
      }
    }
  ])

  connections = jsonencode({
    "Schedule Trigger" = {
      main = [
        [
          {
            node  = "HTTP Request"
            type  = "main"
            index = 0
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  })

  settings = jsonencode({
    executionOrder = "v1"
  })
}

# Example 2: Using workflow_json with file() function (recommended for complex workflows)
resource "n8n_workflow" "from_file" {
  workflow_json = file("${path.module}/workflows/some-workflow.json")
}

# Example 3: Using workflow_json with jsondecode for dynamic values
locals {
  workflow_template = jsondecode(file("${path.module}/workflows/some-template.json"))
}

resource "n8n_workflow" "dynamic" {
  workflow_json = jsonencode(merge(
    local.workflow_template,
    {
      name = "Dynamic Workflow - ${var.environment}"
    }
  ))
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `connections` (String) JSON string representing the workflow connections. Optional if workflow_json is provided.
- `name` (String) Name of the workflow. Optional if workflow_json is provided.
- `nodes` (String) JSON string representing the workflow nodes. Optional if workflow_json is provided.
- `settings` (String) JSON string representing the workflow settings
- `tags` (String) JSON string representing the workflow tags
- `workflow_json` (String) Complete workflow JSON. When provided, individual attributes (name, nodes, connections, etc.) are extracted from this JSON. This allows you to paste an entire n8n workflow export directly.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the workflow was created
- `id` (String) Workflow identifier
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the workflow was last updated

## Import

Workflows can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import n8n_workflow.example 1
```

## Notes

- The `nodes` and `connections` fields must be valid JSON strings
- Workflow IDs are assigned by n8n and cannot be changed
- When a workflow is deleted, it is permanently removed from n8n
- The `active` field controls whether the workflow is running
