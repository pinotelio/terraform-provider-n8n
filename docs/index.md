# n8n Provider

The n8n provider allows you to manage your self-hosted n8n instance infrastructure as code. It provides resources to manage workflows, credentials, and users programmatically through Terraform.

## Features

- **Workflow Management**: Create, read, update, and delete n8n workflows
- **Credential Management**: Manage n8n credentials securely
- **User Management**: Create, read, update, and delete n8n users
- **Data Sources**: Query existing workflows, credentials, and users
- **Full API Support**: Built on the official n8n API

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- n8n self-hosted instance with API access enabled
- n8n API key with appropriate permissions

## Getting Your n8n API Key

1. Log in to your n8n instance
2. Go to **Settings** → **API**
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key and use it in your provider configuration

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    n8n = {
      source = "pinotelio/n8n"
    }
  }
}

provider "n8n" {
  endpoint = "https://your-n8n-instance.com"
  api_key  = "your-api-key-here"
}

# Alternatively, you can use environment variables:
# export N8N_ENDPOINT="https://your-n8n-instance.com"
# export N8N_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) The n8n API key for authentication. May also be provided via N8N_API_KEY environment variable.
- `endpoint` (String) The n8n API endpoint URL. May also be provided via N8N_ENDPOINT environment variable.

## Environment Variables

You can also configure the provider using environment variables:

```bash
export N8N_ENDPOINT="https://your-n8n-instance.com"
export N8N_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Authentication

The provider supports two authentication methods:

1. **Direct Configuration**: Set `endpoint` and `api_key` in the provider block
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `N8N_ENDPOINT` and `N8N_API_KEY` environment variables

The API key must have sufficient permissions to manage the resources you want to create.

## Important Notes

- **Self-Hosted Only**: This provider is designed for self-hosted n8n instances with API access enabled
- **API Key Security**: Always store your API key securely using environment variables or secret management systems
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure your n8n instance version is compatible with the provider
